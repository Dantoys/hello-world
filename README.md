Following Hello world Guide.

Old timer trying to learn programming. and this GitHub tool. So far I like what I see.

Currently Enjoying Endless Sky.

Planning to create content for Endless-Sky and some other Software.

I have experience with AutoLISP, DOS Batch Scripts, some JavaScript, HTML, and can read and modify many other scripting sources when they are well documented.
